# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Neural Network Model to predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup

## Analysis overview

The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural network model to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations with the TensorFlow platform in Python. Analysis had following steps:

* preprocessing the data for the neural network model  
* compile, train and evaluate the model  
* optimize the model  

## Results

### Data preprocessing for the neural network model

### Compilation, training and evaluation of the model

### Optimization of model
